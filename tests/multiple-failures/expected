- pkgs/by-name/A: Invalid directory name "A", must be at most 2 ASCII characters consisting of a-z, 0-9, "-" or "_".
- pkgs/by-name/A/fo@: Invalid package directory name "fo@", must be ASCII characters consisting of a-z, A-Z, 0-9, "-" or "_".
- pkgs/by-name/A/fo@: Path foo is a symlink which cannot be resolved: No such file or directory (os error 2).
- pkgs/by-name/A/fo@: Path package.nix is a symlink pointing to a path outside the directory of that package.
- pkgs/by-name/aa: This is a file, but it should be a directory.
- pkgs/by-name/ba/bar: This path is a file, but it should be a directory.
- pkgs/by-name/ba/baz: "package.nix" must be a file.
- pkgs/by-name/ba/foo: Incorrect directory location, should be pkgs/by-name/fo/foo instead.
- pkgs/by-name/ba/foo: File package.nix at line 4 contains the absolute path expression "/bar", which is not allowed in nixpkgs.
- pkgs/by-name/ba/foo: File package.nix at line 5 contains the path expression "../." which may point outside the directory of that package.
  This is undesirable because it creates dependencies between internal paths, making it harder to reorganise Nixpkgs in the future.
  Alternatives include:
  - If you are creating a new version of a package with a common file between versions, consider following the recommendation in https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/pkgs/by-name#recommendation-for-new-packages-with-multiple-versions.
  - If the path being referenced could be considered a stable interface with multiple uses, consider exposing it via a `pkgs` attribute, then taking it as a attribute argument in package.nix.
  - If the path being referenced is internal and has multiple uses, consider passing the file as an explicit `callPackage` argument in `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`.
  - If the path being referenced is internal and will need to be modified independently of the original, consider copying it into the pkgs/by-name/ba/foo directory.

- pkgs/by-name/ba/foo: File package.nix at line 6 contains the nix search path expression "<nixpkgs>" which may point outside the directory of that package.
- pkgs/by-name/ba/foo: File package.nix at line 7 contains the path expression "./${"test"}", which is not yet supported and may point outside the directory of that package.
- pkgs/by-name/fo/foo: Missing required "package.nix" file.
