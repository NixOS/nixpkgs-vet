- Because pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation exists, the attribute `nonDerivation` must be defined like

    nonDerivation = callPackage ./../by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, the second argument is empty. See the definition in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix:1:

    nonDerivation = self.callPackage ./../by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { };

  Such a definition is provided automatically and therefore not necessary. Please remove it.

This PR introduces additional instances of discouraged patterns as listed above. Merging is discouraged but would not break the base branch.
