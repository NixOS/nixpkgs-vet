- Because pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation exists, the attribute `nonDerivation` must be defined like

    nonDerivation = callPackage ./../by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, the first `callPackage` argument is the wrong path. See the definition in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix:1:

    nonDerivation = callPackage ./../../someDrv.nix { /* ... */ };

This PR introduces the problems listed above. Please fix them before merging, otherwise the base branch would break.
