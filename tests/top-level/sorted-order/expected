- Because pkgs/by-name/a/a exists, the attribute `a` must be defined like

    a = callPackage ./../by-name/a/a/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, the second argument is empty. See the definition in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix:2:

    a = self.callPackage ./../by-name/a/a/package.nix { };

  Such a definition is provided automatically and therefore not necessary. Please remove it.

- Attribute `b` is a new top-level package using `callPackage ... { /* ... */ }`.
  Please define it in pkgs/by-name/b/b/package.nix instead.
  See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details.
  Since the second `callPackage` argument is `{ }`, no manual `callPackage` in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix is needed anymore.

- Because pkgs/by-name/c/c exists, the attribute `c` must be defined like

    c = callPackage ./../by-name/c/c/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, the second argument is empty. See the definition in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix:4:

    c = self.callPackage ./../by-name/c/c/package.nix { };

  Such a definition is provided automatically and therefore not necessary. Please remove it.

- Attribute `d` is a new top-level package using `callPackage ... { /* ... */ }`.
  Please define it in pkgs/by-name/d/d/package.nix instead.
  See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details.
  Since the second `callPackage` argument is `{ }`, no manual `callPackage` in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix is needed anymore.

This PR introduces additional instances of discouraged patterns as listed above. Merging is discouraged but would not break the base branch.
