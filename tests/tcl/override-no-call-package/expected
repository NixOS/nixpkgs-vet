- Because pkgs/development/tcl-modules/by-name/no/nonDerivation exists, the attribute `tclPackages.nonDerivation` must be defined like

    tclPackages.nonDerivation = callPackage ./../development/tcl-modules/by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, it isn't defined that way. See the definition in pkgs/top-level/tcl-packages.nix:18

    nonDerivation = self.someDrv;

This PR introduces the problems listed above. Please fix them before merging, otherwise the base branch would break.
