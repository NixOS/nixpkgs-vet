- Because pkgs/development/tcl-modules/by-name/fo/foo exists, the attribute `tclPackages.foo` must be defined like

    tclPackages.foo = callPackage ./../development/tcl-modules/by-name/fo/foo/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, the first `callPackage` argument is not a path. See the definition in pkgs/top-level/tcl-packages.nix:18:

    foo = tclSelf.callPackage ({ someDrv, someFlag }: someDrv) { someFlag = true; };

This PR introduces the problems listed above. Please fix them before merging, otherwise the base branch would break.
