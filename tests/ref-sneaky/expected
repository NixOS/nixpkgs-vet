- pkgs/by-name/aa/aa: File package.nix at line 1 contains the path expression "../../aa/aa" which may point outside the directory of that package.
  This is undesirable because it creates dependencies between internal paths, making it harder to reorganise Nixpkgs in the future.
  Alternatives include:
  - If you are creating a new version of a package with a common file between versions, consider following the recommendation in https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/pkgs/by-name#recommendation-for-new-packages-with-multiple-versions.
  - If the path being referenced could be considered a stable interface with multiple uses, consider exposing it via a `pkgs` attribute, then taking it as a attribute argument in package.nix.
  - If the path being referenced is internal and has multiple uses, consider passing the file as an explicit `callPackage` argument in `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`.
  - If the path being referenced is internal and will need to be modified independently of the original, consider copying it into the pkgs/by-name/aa/aa directory.
