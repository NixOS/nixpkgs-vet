- Because pkgs/by-name/no/noEval exists, the attribute `pkgs.noEval` must be defined like

    noEval = callPackage ./../by-name/no/noEval/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, the second argument is empty. See the definition in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix:9:

    noEval = self.callPackage ./../by-name/no/noEval/package.nix { };

  Such a definition is provided automatically and therefore not necessary. Please remove it.

- Because pkgs/by-name/on/onlyMove exists, the attribute `pkgs.onlyMove` must be defined like

    onlyMove = callPackage ./../by-name/on/onlyMove/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  However, in this PR, the second argument is empty. See the definition in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix:7:

    onlyMove = self.callPackage ./../by-name/on/onlyMove/package.nix { };

  Such a definition is provided automatically and therefore not necessary. Please remove it.
