# This makes sure to only run one instance of this workflow per individual PR and pushes.
# We need this especially for the release step, because it has side effects.
# But it's also good in general, there's no need to finish action runs for commits
# when you push another one right after.
# Assumption: We push less frequently than it takes for this workflow to finish
